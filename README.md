## Day 1
Today was the first day of our final project. We worked on planning our vision, values, measures of success, working time agreement and the definition of done in the morning. In the afternoon, we discussed our database schema, wireframing for the MVP, technology to be used for the project.

## Day 2
We worked on our schema design, researched implementing PhoneGap, showed "hello world" via our app with PhoneGap, set up our test database for users, wants and products, used an online iOS mobile simulator, started researching Firebase, designed wireframes and started our RSPEC testing.

## Day 3
We wrote our JSON routes, successfully set up and called our API to show JSON to our correct routes, continued to research Firebase, continued to write RSPEC tests for our controllers.
